# Printf ALX Project

#Printf ALX Project
This project is a part of the ALX Software Engineering program. The goal of this project is to implement a custom version of the C standard library function `printf`.

## Usage

To use this `printf` function, simply include the `mian.h` header file in your C program and call the `_printf` function with the desired format string and arguments.

## Project Structure

The `printf` project is organized into several files, including:

- `main.h`: Header file containing function prototypes and struct definitions.
- `_printf.c`: Main implementation of the `printf` function.
- `print_[type].c`: Implementation of various print functions for different format specifiers.
- `_print_utils.c`: Utility functions used by the `printf` function.
- `_printer.c`: Utility functions used by the `printf` function.
- `_handlers.c`: Utility functions used by the `printf` function.
- `_utils.c`: Utility functions used by the `printf` function.
